## Exercise 1.3: Operators & Functions in Python

### Learning Goals

- Implement conditional statements in Python to determine program flow
- Use loops to reduce time and effort in Python programming
- Write functions to organize Python code

### Reflection Questions

1. In this Exercise, you learned how to use if-elif-else statements to run different tasks based on conditions that you define. Now practice that skill by writing a script for a simple travel app using an if-elif-else statement for the following situation:

- The script should ask the user where they want to travel.
- The user’s input should be checked for 3 different travel destinations that you define.
- If the user’s input is one of those 3 destinations, the following statement should be printed: “Enjoy your stay in **\_\_**!”
- If the user’s input is something other than the defined destinations, the following statement should be printed: “Oops, that destination is not currently available.”

> travel = input("Where would you like to travel? ")
> <br>
> if travel == "Tokyo":
> print("Enjoy your stay in Tokyo!")
> elif travel == "Oslo":
> print("Enjoy your stay in Oslo!")
> elif travel == "Monterrey":
> print("Enjoy your stay in Monterrey!")
>
> else:
> print("Oops, that destination is not currently available.")
