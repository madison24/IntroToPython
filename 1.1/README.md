For Task 1.1 I:

1. Already had python installed on my computer - I did so while going through the exercise. So for step 1 I verified my Python version.
2. Created a new virtual environment called "cf-python-base".
3. Created a new folder and on VS Code I made an "add.py" file that included a script to add 2 numbers together and print the result.
4. Set up IPython shell.
5. Used pip freeze to generate a "requirements.txt", then created a new virtual environment "cf-python-copy" and installed packages from the requirements.txt I had just created using pip install -r requirements.txt.
6. Created a Github repo for this course to add folders to with each task.
7. Created this README.md file to document my work.
8. Started a learning journal to talk about what I'm learning/doing in this course.

I then sumbitted all this work to the 1.1 folder on Github.
