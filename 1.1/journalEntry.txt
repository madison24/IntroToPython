Exercise 1.1: Getting Started with Python 
Learning Goals

Summarize the uses and benefits of Python for web development
Prepare your developer environment for programming with Python

Reflection Questions

1. In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?

- Basically frontend is what users see and possibily interact with (buttons, forms, etc) and backend is what is stored in the background (servers, API's, etc). 
As a backend developer you could be making an API that has any kind information you want to store, databases, authentication, and more.

2. Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future. Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice. How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team? Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option? 

- I would start by telling my team how Python is a language thats known to be easy to learn and understand which is a major perk. A big feature of Python is its readability, so anyone with some kind of basic coding experience can glance at a piece of code and understand whats actually happening. 
Like JavaScript, Python uses easy to understand keywords like import, return, etc. They also both share a dynamic typing approach.
Another feature Python has is the number of open-source and proprietary packages available for whatever project you're working on that can be easily imported.

3. Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you. What do you want to learn about Python? What do you want to get out of this Achievement? Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?
- I would like to learn about more packages I can import and use on Python projects and how to utilize them to my advantage.
- I want to be able to add Python to my developer toolkit and become a stronger backend developer.
- In the future I could see myself working on a new database or API for a project of my own, or even something to help a friend/colleague.
