### Why I chose Dictionary for each indivdual recipe

I chose to use the dictionary data structure to store individual recipes because of its use of key-value pairs. Since each recipe will have the keys: name, cooking_time, and ingredients. Along with their values: str, int, and list - it makes the most sense to use a dictionary that can include all varieties of data and their labels.

### Why I chose List for all recipes

I chose the List structure to store ALL recipes because it is easier to organize, add, modify, etc than a dictionary or tuple.
